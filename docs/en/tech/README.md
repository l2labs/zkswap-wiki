## 1.ZKSpeed

ZKSwap's first version of the scaling solution (ZKSpeed) combines the features of ZK-rollup, Validium and Plasma solutions. In addition to this, three optimization improvements including aggregation proof, GPU optimization, and proof circuit optimization are applied to further improve the throughput of the entire network. For details, see the following:

## 2.ZKSwap Design Specification

Thanks to ZKSync who provides the ZK-Rollup framework for ERC20 token L2 transactions. ZKSwap is a Layer-2 token transaction protocol that uses ZK-Rollups on Ethereum and is based on the PLONK proof system. The ZKSwap design specification explicates the ZKSwap protocol and its difference against ZKSync.
