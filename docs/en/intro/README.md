# What is ZKSwap


ZKSwap is a token swap protocol based on Automated Market Maker (AMM). Through ZK-Rollup technology, the full set of uniswap functions are realized in Layer-2, while providing unlimited scalability and privacy. ZKSwap __offers ultra-high throughput Swap infrastucture and transactions without Gas Fees to liquidity providers and traders.__
	
## ZKSwap's Features

At the moment, most decentralized exchange DEXs such as Uniswap are different from centralized exchanges such as Huobi and OKEx. They automate market makers, replace manual quotations with established algorithms, and even remove centralized matching and clearing, while eliminating the market maker in the transaction. Thus, they can provide users with highly secure and confidential transactions.

However, due to the limitations of blockchain technology, long block generation time and slow confirmation speed of the public chain itself, decentralized exchanges are facing pain points such as low throughput, slow processing speed, and high Gas Fees. These pain points directly results in bad overall user trading experience, leading to the fact that decentralized exchanges can not replicate the experience created by centralized exchanges.

But ZKSwap carries out the exchange logic of traditional decentralized exchanges on Layer-2 through ZK-Rollups technology, so that all exchanges are completed on Layer-2, reducing the user's transaction costs while ensuring the user's overall transaction experience. Compared to traditional DEX, ZKSwap has the following advantages:

**0 Gas Fee** : Compared to dozens of dollars worth of Gas Fee resulted from transactions on tranditional Dex (Gas Fee will continue to increase as the price of Ethereum increases), ZKSwap transactions on Layer-2 requires zero Gas Fee，which greatly reduces transaction cost for users.


**High TPS（Transation Per Second）**: 
Hindered by TPS limitations on Ethereum, traditional Dex such as Uniswap has obvious bottleneck in transaction numbers and capacity per second. Through optimizing GPU, ZKSwap can conduct hundreds and thousands of TPS with trustless method. In the case of having enough machines to support expansion, ZKSwap's TPS can theoretically reach 6000.

**Real time transaction**: All transactions on ZKSwap are transfered to Layer-2 and are valid for real-time transction, users DO NOT need to wait for the confirmation time of a block.
